# BESTBUY

## Description

Bestbuy is a simulation of a simple shop, designed by following an OOP-based design approach. 
With this application, you can instatiate different stores (instances) as well as different products (with a certain price and stock quantity) beloging to the store. 
Further, the CLI allows the user to fulfill actions such as viewing the available products along with its prices and quantities, can add products to the shopping basket and can also do a checkout. 
Once the quantity reaches "0" for a product, it's status turns inactive and it's not possible to add this product to the basket anymore. 


## How to use

For this simple project, there is no prior installation of requirements needed. Just open the main.py file, instantiate a store and create a product list, you also can instatiate or remove products via the Products class. The, you simply can run the main.py file in your IDE or prompt 

```python
python main.py
```
to your terminal. 

##  Further Information

It is planned to further develop the best buy app to deepen my knowledge on OOP programming and more complex applications.
